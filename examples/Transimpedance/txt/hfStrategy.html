<p>This procedure is meant for OpAmps with resistive output</p>

<ol>
    <li>Only select operational amplifiers with $R_o \le R_f$
        <ol>
            <li>Calculate the bandwidth as the second order bandwidth</li>
            <li>If $\frac{1}{2\pi R_o C_{\ell}}$ is less than two times the required bandwidth then the bandwidth is the third order bandwidth</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Select the operational amplifier if the calculated bandwidth is large enough.</li>
</ol>
