## Selection procedure OpAmp with respect to the HF performance of the circuit

This procedure is meant for OpAmps with resistive output

1. Only select operational amplifiers with $R_o \le R_f$
   a. Calculate the bandwidth as the second order bandwidth
   b. If $\frac{1}{2\pi R_o C_{\ell}}$ is less than two times the required bandwidth then calculate the bandwidth as the third order bandwidth
2. Select the operational amplifier if the calculated bandwidth is large enough.
