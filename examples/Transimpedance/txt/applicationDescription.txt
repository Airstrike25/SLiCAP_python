<h2>Application description</h2>
<p>A PIN diode receives the signal of an optical signal source. This source evokes a peak signal current of 20$\mu$A in the diode which is accurately related to the optical information.</p>
<p>This PIN diode can be electrically be modeled as a current source in parallel with the junction capacitance. This capacitance varies between 10pF and 20pF depending on the PIN diode reverse voltage and on device tolerances.</p>
<p>The reverse bias voltage of the diode should be between 2V and 5V. At this reverse bias voltage the leakage (dark) current of the diode ranges from 20nA to 50nA.</p>
<p>The signal current of this diode should accurately be converted into a voltage at the input of an ADC. The input impedance of this ADC can be modeled as a resistance of minimally 10k$\Omega$ in parallel with a capacitance of maximally 100pF. The peak signal current should evoke a peak signal voltage of 2V at the ADC input. The ADC input is grounded at one side.</p>
<p>Design an amplifier that converts the PIN diode current into the ADC voltage and that fulfills the requirements listed below.</p>
<ol>
<li>The cathode of the PIN diode sould be connected to the input of the amplifier, the anode to the negative bias voltage.</li>
<li>The amplifier should have an MFM magnitude charactersitic with -3dB bandwidth of 0.5MHz.</li>
<li>The total RMS voltage noise across the load should not exceed 100$\mu$V.</li>
<li>The absolute value of the output offset voltage should be less than 100mV.</li>
<li>The operating temperature range of the amplifier should be from 0 to 50 degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>The amplifier can be supplied from a positive and a negative supply voltage. </li>
<li>The power dissipation of the amplifier should be as low as possible.</li>
<li>Standard SMT devices should be used.</li>
