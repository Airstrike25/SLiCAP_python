---------------------------------------
SLiCAP tutorials written in Jupyter lab
---------------------------------------

- `myFirstRCnetwork.zip <../../../../examples/myFirstRCnetwork/myFirstRCnetwork.zip>`_

  This is a basic tutorial; the *Hello world* of SLiCAP.

- `MOSparams.zip <../../../../examples/MOSparams/MOSparams.zip>`_

  This tutorial shows how to plot parameters against each other.

- `CSstage.zip  <../../../../examples/CSstage/CSresNoise.zip>`_

  This tutorial discusses minimization of the noise figure of a CS stage driven from a resistive source, according to the method
  decribed in `Structured Electronic Design <https://analog-electronics.eu/Structured-Electronic-Design/structured-electronic-design.html>`_,
  Chapter 5.5.

- `FilterDesign.zip <../../../../examples/FilterDesign/FilterDesign.zip>`_

  This tutorial illustrates the use of SLiCAP for designing a fourth-order Linkwitz-Reily filter using a prototype circuit and a prototype transfer function.

- `chargeDriver.zip <../../../../examples/chargeDriver/chargeDriver.zip>`_

  This tutorial shows the analysis of the dynamic response and the stability of a piezo charge driver circuit. It illustrates the use of different data types and the creation of various types of plots.
