Create plots

SLiCAP provides some plot functions that facilitate easy plotting of graphs from execution results, with automatic determination of colors and markers and generation of plot legends and axis labels.

The SLiCAP module `SLiCAPplots.py <../reference/SLiCAPplots.html>`_ supports the following plot functions:

- Plotting of multiple traces with x-y data: **SLiCAPplots.plot(*args)**
- Plotting of functions with a sweep variable and a step variable: **SLiCAPplots.plotSweep(*args)**. These functions should be obtained from execution of an instruction
- Plotting of poles and zeros and root-locus plots: **SLiCAPplots.plotPZ(*args)**

See tutorials for more information.
